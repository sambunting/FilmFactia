# UnamedMovieWebsite

This is a website which I have spent a whole evening on. At the moment, it only shows popular movies, so it obviously needs to more work on it. I'm just happy that I have managed to make something in Node.js if I'm being honest.

It's so unnamed, I havent even bought a domian for it [http://139.59.168.66:3000/](http://139.59.168.66:3000/)
